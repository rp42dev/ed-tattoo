about: >-
  My style is black and grey realism, I love the contrast and the depth that
  black and grey can give. I also love to do colour work, I love the vibrancy
  and the way it can bring a tattoo to life. I'm always happy to do custom work.


  The studio is located in Oslo and has a very relaxed and friendly atmosphere. Car parking is available outside the studio.
