title: The Studio
---
The studio is located in Oslo and has a very relaxed and friendly atmosphere, and is easily accessible by public transport. My goal is to create a space where people can feel comfortable and safe, and where they can get the best possible experience. 

The environment is important to me, and I want to make sure that my clients feel safe and comfortable. It has all the equipment needed to create a safe and sterile environment for both the artist and the client.
