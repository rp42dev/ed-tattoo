      I'm a Tattoo Artist, I have been tattooing for years. My style is black
      and grey realism, as I love the contrast and the depth that black and grey
      can give. 


      I also love to create pieces that are very detailed and have a lot of depth to them. I'm always happy to do custom work, so if you have an idea for a tattoo that you would like to get, please get in touch and we can discuss it.

      The studio has a very relaxed and friendly atmosphere, and is easily
      accessible by public transport. My goal is to create a space where people
      can feel comfortable and safe, and where they can get the best possible
      experience. 


      The environment is important to me, and I want to make sure that my clients feel safe and comfortable. It has all the equipment needed to create a safe and sterile environment for both the artist and the client.
