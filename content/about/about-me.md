I'm a Tattoo Artist, I have been tattooing for years. My style is black and grey realism, as I love the contrast and the depth that black and grey can give. 

I also love to create pieces that are very detailed and have a lot of depth to them. I'm always happy to do custom work, so if you have an idea for a tattoo that you would like to get, please get in touch and we can discuss it.
